# eJamtest

This project is a front-end application for the eJam test. The application is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a popular framework for building server-side rendered React applications, and other dependencies such as [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Available Scripts

In addition to the `npm run dev` command for starting the development server, the following scripts are available:

- `npm run build`: This command builds the production-ready version of the application.
- `npm run start`: This command starts the production server for the application.
- `npm run lint`: This command runs the ESLint linter on the code.
- `npm run lint:fix`: This command runs the ESLint linter on the code and automatically fixes any issues it finds.

For more information on the available dependencies and scripts, see the `package.json` file.
